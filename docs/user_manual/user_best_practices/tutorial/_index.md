# Overview

You can deploy OceanBase Community Edition in the following ways:

* Quick deployment: If you want to quickly deploy a standalone edition to experience its features, deploy OceanBase Community Edition by referring to the quick deployment solution.
* Standard deployment: If you want to perform standard deployment in a production environment, deploy OceanBase Community Edition by referring to the standard deployment solution.


## Quick deployment

For non-natively supported operating systems such as Mac OS and Windows, we recommend that you deploy the database by using the Docker image. For more information, see [Quick experience](./quickstart).
For natively supported operating systems such as Linux, we recommend that you deploy the database by using OceanBase Deployer (OBD) in a one-click manner. For more information, see [Quick experience](./deploy_in_production).

## Standard deployment

In an offline environment, we recommend that you use OBD for standard deployment. For more information, see [Deploy OceanBase Database offline](200.local-deployment/500.deploy-oceanbase-database-in-the-production-environment.md).
